title: Exploring Dimensions of Generalizability and Few-shot Transfer for Text-to-SQL
  Semantic Parsing
abstract: 'Existing work on generalization in Text-to-SQL semantic parsing has been
  restricted to a zero-shot cross-domain setting. In this paper, we introduce Spider-Gen:
  a Text-to-SQL benchmark to develop a paradigm of transfer learning across distinct
  dimensions of generalization in Text-to-SQL semantic parsing. The Spider-Gen benchmark
  focuses on few-shot adaption for Cross-domain, Lexical, and Structural generalization
  of Text-to-SQL models. Through our experiments with the Spider-Gen dataset, we show
  that Seq2Seq language models struggle to generalize against change in data distribution,
  lexical changes in database schema, and changes in SQL query complexity. Our experiments
  also reveal that performing few-shot fine-tuning helps Text-to-SQL models to generalize
  across these changes. However, such few-shot adaptation comes with a negative effect
  on the knowledge learnt during training. Hence, we also explore Parameter-efficient
  Fine-tuning methods to overcome the limitations of Seq2Seq Text-to-SQL models. We
  release the Spider-Gen dataset publicly to facilitate further research in generalization
  and transfer learning across various dimensions in Text-to-SQL semantic parsing.'
