title: Multi-Task Learning Framework for Extracting Emotion Cause Span and Entailment
  in Conversations
abstract: Predicting emotions expressed in text is a well-studied problem in the NLP
  community. Recently there has been active research in extracting the cause of an
  emotion expressed in text. Most of the previous work has done causal emotion entailment
  in documents. In this work, we propose neural models to extract emotion cause span
  and entailment in conversations. For learning such models, we use RECCON dataset,
  which is annotated with cause spans at the utterance level. In particular, we propose
  MuTEC, an end-to-end Multi-Task learning framework for extracting emotions, emotion
  cause, and entailment in conversations. This is in contrast to existing baseline
  models that use ground truth emotions to extract the cause. MuTEC performs better
  than the baselines for most of the data folds provided in the dataset.
