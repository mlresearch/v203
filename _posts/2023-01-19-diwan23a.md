title: Zero-shot Video Moment Retrieval With Off-the-Shelf Models
abstract: For the majority of the machine learning community, the expensive nature
  of collecting high-quality human-annotated data and the inability to efficiently
  finetune very large state-of-the-art pretrained models on limited compute are major
  bottlenecks for building models for new tasks. We propose a zero-shot simple approach
  for one such task, Video Moment Retrieval (VMR), that does not perform any additional
  finetuning and simply repurposes off-the-shelf models trained on other tasks. Our
  three-step approach consists of moment proposal, moment-query matching and postprocessing,
  all using only off-the-shelf models. On the QVHighlights benchmark for VMR, we vastly
  improve performance of previous zero-shot approaches by at least 2.5x on all metrics
  and reduce the gap between zero-shot and state-of-the-art supervised by over 74%.
  Further, we also show that our zero-shot approach beats non-pretrained supervised
  models on the Recall metrics and comes very close on mAP metrics; and that it also
  performs better than the best pretrained supervised model on shorter moments. Finally,
  we ablate and analyze our results and propose interesting future directions.
