title: 'MetaXCR: Reinforcement-Based Meta-Transfer Learning for Cross-Lingual Commonsense
  Reasoning'
abstract: Commonsense reasoning (CR) has been studied in many pieces of domain and
  has achieved great progress with the aid of large datasets. Unfortunately, most
  existing CR datasets are built in English, so most previous work focus on English.
  Furthermore, as the annotation of commonsense reasoning is costly, it is impossible
  to build a large dataset for every novel task. Therefore, there are growing appeals
  for Cross-lingual Low-Resource  Commonsense Reasoning, which aims to leverage diverse
  existed English datasets to help the model adapt to new cross-lingual target datasets
  with limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a multi-source adapter for
  cross-lingual low-resource Commonsense Reasoning (MetaXCR). In this framework, we
  first extend meta learning by incorporating multiple training datasets to learn
  a generalized task adapters across different tasks. Then, we further introduce a
  reinforcement-based sampling strategy to help the model sample the source task that
  is the most helpful to the target task. Finally, we introduce two types of cross-lingual
  meta-adaption methods to enhance the  performance of models on target languages.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate MetaXCR is superior over state-of-the-arts, while
  being trained with fewer parameters than other work.
