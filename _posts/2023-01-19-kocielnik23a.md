title: Can You Label Less by Using Out-of-Domain Data? Active & Transfer Learning
  with Few-shot Instructions
abstract: "Labeling social-media data for custom dimensions of toxicity and social
  bias is challenging and labor-intensive. Existing transfer and active learning approaches
  meant to reduce annotation effort require fine-tuning, which suffers from over-fitting
  to noise and can cause domain shift with small sample sizes. In this work, we propose
  a novel Active Transfer Few-shot Instructions (ATF) approach which requires no fine-tuning.
  ATF leverages the internal linguistic knowledge of pre-trained language models (PLMs)
  to facilitate the transfer of information from\r existing pre-labeled datasets (source-domain
  task) with minimum labeling effort on unlabeled target data (target-domain task).
  Our strategy can yield positive transfer achieving a mean AUC gain of 10.5% compared
  to no transfer with a large 22b parameter PLM. We further show that annotation of
  just a few target-domain samples via active learning can be beneficial for transfer,
  but the impact diminishes with more annotation effort (26% drop in gain between
  100 and 2000 annotated examples). Finally, we find that not all transfer scenarios
  yield a positive gain, which seems related to the PLMs initial performance on the
  target-domain task.\r "
