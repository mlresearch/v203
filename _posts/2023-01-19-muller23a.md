title: 'Languages You Know Influence Those You Learn: Impact of Language Characteristics
  on Multi-Lingual Text-to-Text Transfer'
abstract: In this work, we analyze a pre-trained mT5 to discover the attributes of
  cross-lingual connections learned by this model. Through a statistical interpretation
  framework over 90 language pairs across three tasks, we show that transfer performance
  can be modeled by a few linguistic and data-derived features. These observations
  enable us to interpret cross-lingual understanding of the mT5 model. Through these
  observations, one can favorably choose the best source language for a task, and
  can anticipate its training data demands. A key finding of this work is that similarity
  of syntax, morphology and phonology are good predictors of cross-lingual transfer,
  significantly more than just the lexical similarity of languages. For a given language,
  we are able to predict zero-shot performance, that increases on a logarithmic scale
  with the number of few-shot target language data points.
