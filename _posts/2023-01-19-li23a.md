title: 'This joke is [MASK]: Recognizing Humor and Offense with Prompting'
abstract: Humor is a magnetic component in everyday human interactions and communications.
  Computationally modeling humor enables NLP systems to entertain and engage with
  users. We investigate the effectiveness of prompting, a new transfer learning paradigm
  for NLP, for humor recognition. We show that prompting performs similarly to finetuning
  when numerous annotations are available, but gives stellar performance in low-resource
  humor recognition. The relationship between humor and offense is also inspected
  by applying influence functions to prompting; we show that models could rely on
  offense to determine humor during transfer.
